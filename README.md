# Liver Guardian ML

Liver Guardian ML is a machine learning project designed to assist in analyzing and predicting liver-related health conditions using structured clinical and laboratory datasets. The project provides an end-to-end pipeline covering data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and reporting.

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MrCoss/Liver-Guardian-ML.git
   cd Liver-Guardian-ML
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

Open the main Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook main.ipynb
```

Or run Python scripts (if modularized):

```bash
python main.py
```

---

## Reports

Reports are generated automatically after pipeline execution and stored in `reports/`. These include:

* Data report
* EDA summary
* Preprocessing summary
* Validation metrics

---

## Future Enhancements

* Integration with deep learning models
* API deployment for predictions
* Interactive dashboards
